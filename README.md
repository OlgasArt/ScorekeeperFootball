# FootballScoreKeeper
This  is my Scorekeeper app for tracking scores in the football game.
It is shared for free for non-commercial usage.

Features include:

- multiple amounts of points that can be scored;
- app is divided into two columns, one for each team;
- each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the current score for that team.
- each column contains multiple buttons to track goal, yellow and red cards;
- the layout contains a ‘reset’ button;
- the abiliity to type team names (EditText feature);
- scroll view.

The code adheres to all of the following best practices:

Text sizes are defined in sp;
Lengths are defined in dp;
Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other;
All methods are named by their intended effect or in the style required by a callback interface;
There are no unnecessary blank lines.One variable is declared per declaration line.
